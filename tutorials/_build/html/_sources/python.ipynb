    "## Indentation  \n",
    "\n",
    "A key difference of Python compared to most other programming languages is that in Python indentation matters (the spaces at the beginning of every line of code). Python uses indentation to deliminate blocks of code. The number of spaces you use is up to you but you need to be consistent. Commonly 4 spaces are used.  \n",

    "print(\"Here we add an if statement\")\n",
    "if a > 5:\n",
    "    print(a)\n",
    "else:\n",
    "    print(\"a is < 5\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "If you were to skip the indentation, Python will throw an error:  \n",
    "\n",
    "```IndentationError: expected an indented block```  \n",
    "This might feel like a nuissance at first, but after a while it will feel natural and keep your code organised.\n",

    "### R - {}  \n",
    "\n",
    "In R, a consistent use of indentation will make code much easier to read but is not strictly necessary. Functions, loops and statemtent are delimited by ```{}```.  \n",

    "### Matlab - end  \n",
    "\n",
    "In Matlab, a consistent use of indentation will make code much easier to read but is not strictly necessary. Ending each line with ```;``` will prevent printing the result to the console. Functions loops and statements are closed by ```end```.  \n",
