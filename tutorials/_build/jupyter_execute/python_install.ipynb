    "# Minimal install conda, mamba, Python  \n",
    "\n",
    "The very easiest way to get a minimal install of [Conda](https://conda.io/), [Mamba](https://github.com/mamba-org/mamba) and Python, with conda-forge as default channel is to install [Miniforge](https://github.com/conda-forge/miniforge).  \n",
    "Once Miniforge is installed, you should be able to use ```conda``` and ```mamba``` in your terminal.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The very easiest way to install Miniforge is to download and run a provided installer for your OS  from [https://conda-forge.org/download/](https://conda-forge.org/download/)  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Mac & Linux**: Download the installer and run ```bash Miniforge3-$(uname)-$(uname -m).sh```\n",
    "**Windows**: download and run the Windows installer.  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Note for Windows users:**  \n",
    "By default the commands are not added to the path environment (making them available in the default Windows Command Prompt (CMD)). This is a precautious step, to avoid chances of software conflicts.  \n",
    "*Solutions:*  \n",
    "\n",
    "* Option 1 (easiest, safest): Use *Anaconda Prompt*, like the freshly installed *Miniforge Prompt*\n",
    "* Option 2: Initialise conda in the *Anaconda Prompt* by typing ```conda init```. Close your propmpt window and open it again. Now the commands should be available\n",
    "* Option 3: [Manually add](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/previous-versions/office/developer/sharepoint-2010/ee537574(v=office.14)#to-add-a-path-to-the-path-environment-variable) ```C:\\Users\\myusername\\miniforge3\\condabin``` to the path environment. This will allow you to use the commands from any prompt, with limited risk of conflicts with other software.  \n",
