    "\n",
    "We will implement:  \n",
    "✅ A **class** `AcousticWave`  \n",

    "✅ A **proper package structure**  \n",

    "Typically a Python package contains at least an initialisation file (__init__.py), and a number of modules (containing classes, functions and variables) stored in **.py* files, a *setup.py* file and a *readme* file.  \n",

    "Create a directory and organize files as follows, all modules to be included in the oackage should be organised in a subfolder. The name of the subfolder defines how the package will be imported (here we call the folder uwa and will import the package using `import uwa`. This folder has to include an initialisation file `__init__.py` and at least one module, here `wave.py`. In the main package folder we have a `toml` file, contains installation and metadata information (in older versions this was a `setup.py` file), a `README.md` which conains a project description, `LICENSE` which is the license text and if needed, a `requirements.txt` file:  \n",

    "\n",
    "### 1) Create an initialisation file `__init__.py`**\n",
    "\n",
    "The `__init__.py` file basically tells our Python package to look for bits and pieces in the folder where the `__init__.py` file is located (prior to Python 3.3 it was impossible to import funcitons from folders without an `__init__.py` file).  \n",
    "\n",
    "Here we import the class `AcousticWave`and the functions `wavelength`, `wave_number` and `nearfield_distance` from the the module `acoustic` (contained in the `acoustic.py` file in the same directory):  \n",

    "# uwa/__init__.py\n",
    "from .wave import AcousticWave, deadzone\n",
    "```\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "A major benefit of initialisation files is that we can control which modules or sub-packages are avaialable when the package is imported . Through importing functions or classes in the init file, we can use them without the need to import them explicitly.  \n",
    "\n",
    "As a consequence of this init file, at a later stage, when we ar eusing our package we can use the class AcousticWave as follows:  \n",
    "\n",
    "```{code-block} python\n",
    "from uwa.uwa import AcousticWave\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "instead of having to import it from the `wave` module within the `uwa` package:  \n",
    "\n",
    "```{code-block} python\n",
    "from uwa.wave import AcousticWave\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Besides loading modules or subpackages, the init file can also be used to run some code, when the package is imported (logging or setup codes would be an example).  \n",
    "\n",
    "### 2) Create the wave module `wave.py`  \n",
    "\n",
    "- import dependencies: Our package depends on the `numpy` and `math` packages for some basic operations.  \n",
    "- class definition: We start by defining a `class AcousticWave`  \n",
    "- class docstring: The first part is the docstring, containing information on what the purpose of this class is, and the a description of the input variables or class attributes.  \n",
    "- class initialisation: the class contains a self reference instance `self` and the two needed attributes `frequency` and `speed` which we assign to self during the initialisation, such that we can use it within the methods described in the class\n",
    "- define methods: we defined 3 methods within the `AcousticWave`class. `wave_number` and `wave_length` only depend on the attributes of the class, while `nearfield_distance` needs an additional input value.\n",
    "- define function `deadzone` outside of the class definition  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "```{note}\n",
    "*self*  \n",
    "n Python, self refers to the instance of a class and is used to access the instance's attributes and methods. It allows each object created from a class to maintain its own state and interact with its own data. When you define a method in a class, self is the first parameter, and it is automatically passed when you call the method on an object. This allows you to work with the specific instance of the class. \n",
    "In our example `self` allows our functions or methods to access the `frequency` and `speed` attributes from the AcousticWave class.  \n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "```{note}\n",
    "*Function or method?*  \n",
    "Most likely the nomenclature is not used consistently within this tutorial...Technically a `function`can be defined in any part of a code and form standalone blocks of code. `methods` are tied to an object or class and can't operate outside of this. `functions`are defined locally or globally while `methods`are defined within classes and called on class instances.  \n",
