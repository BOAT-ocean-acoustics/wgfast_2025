    "In 1989 [Guido van Rossum](https://github.com/gvanrossum), had a bit of spare time and started developping the first implementation of Python to have a way to test scripts quickly and easily on the [Amoeba system](https://www.cs.vu.nl/pub/amoeba/). At the time Guido was working at [CWI - Centrum Wiskunde & Informatica](https://www.cwi.nl/en/), in Amsterdam, the Netherlands and named it after the [Monty Python Flying Circus](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/tv/monty_python_s_flying_circus). Guido is still a core developer to date and was the lead developper until 2018 when he announced that he will go on permanent vacation from his responsibilities as Benevolant Dictator For Life (BDFL). He remained president of the [Python Software Foundation](https://www.python.org/psf-landing/) until 2023. Since 2023 [Dawn Gibson Wages](https://dawnwages.info/) is the new president of the foundation.  \n",
