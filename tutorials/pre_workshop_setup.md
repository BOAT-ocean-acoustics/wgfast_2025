&nbsp;

- When you use Git from the Command Line, all commands start with `git`
  - For example, `git init` initializes a repository and `git add .` stages all the file changes before they are committed to you local repository

- When you use GitHub Desktop, the same Git commands are executed
- As with any collaborative project, there is etiquette to follow. We will go over these in the workshop.
  - Workflow
  - Commit messages
  - Branch names
  - Issues
  - Pull Requests
