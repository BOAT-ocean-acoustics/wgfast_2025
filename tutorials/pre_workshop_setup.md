# Before the workshop

Please do the following:

1. Create a GitHub account if you do not already have one
2. Either: Install GitHub Desktop (to work from a GUI) **or** install Git (to work from a terminal)
3. Install Miniforge (Minimal install)

---

## Some things to keep in mind

- You do not need to install Git if you are going to use GitHub Desktop. It will install Git for you if it is not already installed.

- Git and GitHub Interactions

- When you use Git in a terminal, all commands start with `git`
  - For example, `git init` initializes a repository and `git add .` stages all the file changes before they are committed to you local repository

- When you use GitHub Desktop, Git commands are executed behind the scenes
- As with any collaborative project, there is etiquette to follow. We will go over these in the workshop.
  - Workflow
  - Commit messages
