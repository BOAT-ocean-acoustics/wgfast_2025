## What is GitHub?

[GitHub](https://github.com/) is a web-based hosting service that manages Git repositories. GitHub **is not** Git. It is the "thing" you use to share and collaborate on the work you do in your Git repository. GitHub is like a bustling open-air market, where each stall (repository/project) offers unique goods, crafted by different merchants (developers - you!).

GitHub is one of the most popular hosting platforms for version control systems, but there are others including [GitLab](https://gitlab.com/) and [Bitbucket](https://bitbucket.org/).

## Create a GitHub account

1. Go to <https://github.com> and create an account

## Create a repository  

To get to your profile or repositories, click on your icon in the upper right corner...

... and a menu of options will appear. Choose `Your repositories`
<br>

If you have not created any repositories yet, you will see a page similar to this:

To create a new repository:
- Click the green `New` 
- Add a repository name, and short description
- Keep the repository public
- Initialize the repository with a README file. These are initially written in Markdown and are a great way to tell people what your repository (project) is about.
- Add a .gitignore file if there are files in your repository you want Git to ignore (e.g. RStudio project files).
- Click `Create repository`
